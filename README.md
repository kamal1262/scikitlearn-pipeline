# aws assignment: ML Model Predictive Maintenance


3D technologies, a ASEAN based company provides telemetry devices to its customer. These devices transmit daily aggregated telemetry attributes back to the company Customer Services department. To reduce cost, head of customer services want to do predictive maintenance or time-based preventive maintenance for cost savings.
To predict the devices failure, a machine learning (ML) based predictive model will be developed using the aggregated telemetry data. This ML model will predict the probability of telemetry device.
To build the ML model, I have aggregated the data to predict the probability of telemetry device failure within 07 days. The details about the data pre-processing and techniques are describe in Feature Engineering section.

## Exploratory data analysis:
For the exploratory analysis, the following machine and tool has been used â€“
1. Google bigquery
2. Jupyter notebook ( python 3.7)
